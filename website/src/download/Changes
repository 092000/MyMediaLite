0.05	2010-11-02
        - rename the library from 'Algorithms' to 'MyMediaLite'
	- engines
          - more fixes to ensure locale-independent output of '.' as floating
            point separator
          - MF and linear  engines for item prediction: rename init_f_mean to
            init_mean and init_f_stdev to init_stdev
          - return hyperparameter values in ItemAttributeSVM.ToString() and all
            kNN engines
          - fix bug that caused crashes with new users/items for user/item knn
            rating prediction engines
          - kNN: do not store hyperparameter values in model files (consistent
            with the other engines)
          - RatingPredictor: shorter property names:
            - MinRatingValue -> MinRating
            - MaxRatingValue -> MaxRating
          - interface names now all start with 'I'
          - BiasedMatrixFactorization: model biases explicitly, allow separate
            regularization
        - command-line programs
          - rating prediction: map internal user/item IDs back to the original
            ones (this bug was found and reported by Thorsten Angermann)
          - configure recommender engines via reflection
          - improve usage information
          - item prediction: rename option 'prec_cutoff' to 'prec5_cutoff'
          - item prediction: fix iteration statistics display
          - rating prediction: display correct number of users and items
        - evaluation
           - correct computation of AUC if there are irrelevant items in the
             test set
	- misc:
          - add unit tests for some basic data types (Christina Lichtenth√§ler)
          - improve exception handling in CorrelationMatrix
          - rename util.EngineStorage class to util.Engines, because it now
            contains different utility methods, not just for storing
          - code clean-ups
          - more XML API documentation
          - add IronPython examples

0.04	2010-10-21
	- new features:
          - Map user/item IDs to internal IDs on the fly. That makes it
            unnecessary to convert datasets before using them with the
            MyMediaLite command-line tools.
          - MAP (mean average precision) for item recommender evaluation
          - API documentation in XML (generated from the inline XML docs)
          - support recommenders that use relations over users and/or items
            using the interfaces UserRelationAwareRecommender and
           ItemRelationAwareRecommender
          - SocialMF by Jamali+Ester 2010
        - engine changes:
          - add global bias term to BiasedMatrixFactorization
        - command-line programs:
          - allow input from STDIN and output to STDOUT
	  - nicer time output for both demo programs
          - nicer result output for both demo programs
	  - rating prediction: save model earlier
          - rating prediction: option to stop iterating if there is no progress
          - always output '.'-separated floating point numbers, independent
            of the current locale.
          - better documentation of arguments
          - rating prediction: MAE and RMSE cutoff values for iteration search
          - give out data loading time
          - give out iteration statistics even if program stopped with Ctrl-C
	- interface changes:
	  - use IterativeModel interface in rating prediction program
	  - consistent parameters for RatingData constructor
	  - SparseBooleanMatrix now allows [x, y] and [x] access, has 
            properties instead of GetXXX() methods
          - Matrix now allows [x, y] access
          - UserAttributeAwareRecommender and ItemAttributeAwareRecommender
            now both are completely property-based
