  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
  <h3>What are the differences between MyMediaLite and the [% INCLUDE link link='mymediaframework' %]?</h3>
  <p>
  <ol>
    <li>MyMediaLite is free and open source software, published under the terms of GPLv3, whereas
        the MyMedia Framework is only available for non-commercial uses.</li>
    <li>MyMediaLite is, as the name says, leaner and simpler and carries less overhead, in particular:
       <ul>
         <li>it does not presuppose special database schemas</li>
         <li>it does not have a database connector</li>
         <li>it contains a different set of recommender algorithms (even though there is big overlap)</li>
         <li>it does not contain advanced features such as complex engines, recommender flows, (not yet) filters, etc.</li>
       </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
