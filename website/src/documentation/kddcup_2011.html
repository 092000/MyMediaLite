  <h2>KDD Cup 2011</h2>
  <p>
    Since version 1.0, MyMediaLite supports reading in the
    <a href="http://kddcup.yahoo.com">KDD Cup 2011</a> data files,
    so that you can run existing recommenders on that data set,
    or implement new ones using the MyMediaLite infrastructure.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  To find out more about the challenge, please go the
  <a href="http://kddcup.yahoo.com/">official KDD Cup 2011 website.</a>
  </p>
  
  <h2>Lots of Data</h2>
  <p>
    The KDD Cup 2011 datasets are huge:
    The training set for Track 1 contains about 300 million ratings,
    while the training set for Track 2 contains about 60 million ratings.
    We took care to implement the MyMediaLite algorithms and data structures
    so that they do not waste memory, but we recommend to run MyMediaLite for
    the KDD Cup 2011 on a computer with at least 8 GB (track 1) or 4 GB (track 2).
  </p>

    Patches that improve memory use and runtime are, as well as other improvements,
    of course
