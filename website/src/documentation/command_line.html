<h2>Rating Prediction</h2>
<p>
  The programs included with MyMediaLite expect the data to be in a simple text format:
  <pre>
  user_id item_id rating
  </pre>
  where user_id and item_id are integers referring to users and items, respectively,
  and rating is a floating-point number expressing how much a user likes an item.
  The whitespace between the values can contain an arbitrary number of space and tab characters.
  If there are more than three columns, all additional columns will be ignored.

  An small example dataset:
  <pre>
    1       1       5
    1       2       3
    1       3       4
    1       4       3
    1       5       3
    1       7       4
  </pre>

  The general usage of the rating prediction program is as follows:
  <pre>
  RatingPrediction.exe TRAINING_FILE TEST_FILE METHOD [ARGUMENTS] [OPTIONS]
  </pre>
</p>

<h2>Item Prediction from Implicit Feedback</h2>
<p>
  The item prediction program behaves similarly to the rating prediction program,
  so we concentrate on the differences here.
</p>

<p>
  The third column in the data files may be omitted. If it is present, it will be ignored.
  
  <pre>ItemPrediction.exe TRAINING_FILE TEST_FILE METHOD [ARGUMENTS] [OPTIONS]</pre>
</p>
</div>
