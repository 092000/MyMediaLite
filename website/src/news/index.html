    <ul>
      <li>Support for recommender engines that use relations over users and/or items.
          To demonstrate the new interfaces, we implemented SocialMF, based on the
          ACM RecSys 2010 Best Paper by Jamali and Ester.</li>
      <li>Additional measure for item prediction evaluation: mean average precision (MAP)</li>
    </ul>

  <p>
    <b>September 30, 2010.</b>
    MyMediaLite developers [% INCLUDE link link='zeno' %]
    and
    [% INCLUDE link link='steffen' %],
    supervised by
    <a href="../personen/lst_en.html">Lars Schmidt-Thieme</a>,
    received two awards at the
    <em>
     <a href="http://www.dai-labor.de/camra2010/challenge-winners/">
     Context-aware Movie Recommendation Challenge (CAMRa),
     </a>
    </em>
    which was held at the <a href="http://recsys.acm.org/2010/">ACM Conference on Recommender Systems</a>
    in Barcelona.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Goal of the challenge was to recommend
    individual movies for visitors of the
    <a href="http://www.moviepilot.de/">MoviePilot</a> website
    in a certain period, e.g. the Christmas week.
    In the 'Live Evaluation' track,
    the quality of the recommendations was judged by
    MoviePilot users after watching the movies.
    This is in contrast to the usual evaluation in such challenges,
    which is often based on simulated users and records of past user behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
    The method used for the 'Live Evaluation' track was the MyMediaLite engine
    <a href="http://gitorious.org/mymedialite/mymedialite/blobs/master/Algorithms/item_recommender/BPRMF.cs">BPR-MF</a>,
    matrix factorization optimized for Bayesian Personalized Ranking, described in
    <a href="../../pub/pdfs/Rendle_et_al2009-Bayesian_Personalized_Ranking.pdf">this UAI 2009 paper</a>.
