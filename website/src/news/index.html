  <a name="0.08"><h2>MyMediaLite 0.08 has been released</h2></a>
  <p>
    <b>December 09, 2010.</b>
    There have been several changes:
    Most notably, we now have the API documentation
    in the packages and on the website.
    Another programmer-visible change is that our namespaces now have <code>CamelCase</code>
    instead of <code>lower_case</code> names.
    <a href="../documentation/use_engine_from_ruby.html">This allows MyMediaLite to be called from IronRuby</a>.

  <a name="camra"><h2>MyMediaLite successfully used in live evaluation</h2></a>
  <p>
    <b>September 30, 2010.</b>
    MyMediaLite developers [% INCLUDE link link='zeno' %]
    and
    [% INCLUDE link link='steffen' %],
    supervised by
    <a href="../personen/lst_en.html">Lars Schmidt-Thieme</a>,
    received two awards at the
    <em>
     <a href="http://www.dai-labor.de/camra2010/challenge-winners/">
     Context-aware Movie Recommendation Challenge (CAMRa),
     </a>
    </em>
    which was held at the <a href="http://recsys.acm.org/2010/">ACM Conference on Recommender Systems</a>
    in Barcelona.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Goal of the challenge was to recommend
    individual movies for visitors of the
    <a href="http://www.moviepilot.de/">moviepilot.de</a> website
    in a certain period, e.g. the Christmas week.
    In the 'Live Evaluation' track,
    the quality of the recommendations was judged by
    <a href="http://www.moviepilot.de/">moviepilot.de</a> users after watching the movies.
    This is in contrast to the usual evaluation in such challenges,
    which is often based on simulated users and records of past user behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
    The method used for the 'Live Evaluation' track was the MyMediaLite engine
    <a href="http://gitorious.org/mymedialite/mymedialite/blobs/master/Algorithms/item_recommender/BPRMF.cs">BPR-MF</a>,
    matrix factorization optimized for Bayesian Personalized Ranking, described in
    <a href="../../pub/pdfs/Rendle_et_al2009-Bayesian_Personalized_Ranking.pdf">this UAI 2009 paper</a>.
