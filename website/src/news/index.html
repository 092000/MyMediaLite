    <b>October 20, 2010.</b>
    The new release ships many bug fixes, improvements, and some new features:
    <ul>
      <li>Support for recommender engines that use relations over users and/or items.
          To demonstrate the new interfaces, we implemented SocialMF, based on the
          ACM RecSys 2010 Best Paper by Jamali and Ester.</li>
      <li>Additional measure for item prediction evaluation: mean average precision (MAP)</li>
    </ul>
