We use a blending of guidelines that are used in the C# and Java communities.
We apologize to both camps for this heresy.

1. Class, interface, method and property names are written in CamelCase.
2. Interface names have a preceding 'I'.
3. Enum values are written in UPPER_CASE.
4. Namespace names below MyMedia are written in lower_case.
5. Field variables, local variables, and method parameters are written in
   lower_case.
6. Properties with default accessors are defined in one line.
7. 'using' declarations start with the 'System' namespaces, followed by all
   other namespaces. Those two groups of declarations are internally sorted
   by alphabet.
8. After the 'using' declarations, there are two empty lines.
9. If there are minimum and maximum values as method parameters, the minimum
   value always comes first.
10. One file per externally used class
11. Prefer interface types for method arguments and return types.
