Use the style guide when it helps, ignore it when it's in the way. --Guido van Rossum
----
We use a blending of guidelines that are used in the C# and Java communities.
We apologize to both camps for this heresy.

Naming
1. Class, interface, method and property names are written in CamelCase.
2. Interface names have a preceding 'I'.
3. Enum values are written in UPPER_CASE.
4. Namespace names below MyMedia are written in lower_case.
5. Field variables, local variables, and method parameters are written in
   lower_case.

Properties
6. It is okay to define simple properties in one line.

Using
7. 'using' declarations start with the 'System' namespaces, followed by all
   other namespaces. Those two groups of declarations are internally sorted
   by alphabet.
8. After the 'using' declarations, there are two empty lines.

Class definitions
9. One file per externally used class

Methods
10. Prefer interface types for method arguments and return types.

Spacing
11. There must be a space between if, for(each), while and the next parenthesis.
12. There is no space between a method name and the parenthesis.
13. There must be spaces around binary operators like =, +, /, +=, ==, etc.
14. There are no spaces between unary operators like ++, --, etc and the variable
    they modify.
15. There is no space between the datatype and the [] in array declarations.
16. Use a space (or newline) after a comma, semicolon, or curly brace.

Curly braces
16. Do not use curly braces for simple if, for(each), and while statements.

Specific standards for ordering (in argument lists, data formats)
a. user_id, item_id, rating, date/time
b. training_data, test_data
c. row, column, value
d. min, max
