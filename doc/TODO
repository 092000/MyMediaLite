Recommender functionality
 - automated hyperparameter search
 - add filtering mechanism (pre-filter, post-filter)
 - support for non-binary attributes: real, nominal, textual descriptions
 - directly support MovieLens u.item and u.user files and MovieLens 1M data format
 - support for more relation types: weighted, ternary, multiple relations
 - additional engines
   - item-to-item CF (Linden et al., 2003)
   - non-negative matrix factorization
   - matrix factorization learned with alternating least squares/batch gradient descent
   - adaptive kNN by Koren+Bell
   - MF with Euclidean Embeddings
   - scalable CF by Koren: http://research.yahoo.com/pub/2435

   - Content-boosted CF http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.73.8546&rep=rep1&type=pdf
   - restricted boltzmann machines
   - http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v11/seldin10a.html
 - time-aware rating and item prediction
   - timeSVD++
 - new engine types: TagRecommender, ContextAwareRecommender, SequentialRecommender
 - ensembles
   - ranking ensembles
   - stacking ensembles
   - ensembles for new users/new items
 - add more content-based routines (using Lemur?)
 - IItemRecommender: add CanPredict(user_id) method
 - evaluation
   - allow new user evaluation for item prediction
   - support different CV protocols: leave-one-out, leave-one-out-per-user, k-fold CV, chronological splits, user-/item-stratified CV
   - support evaluation protocols w/ repeated events
   - faster evaluation routines
     - approximate AUC
     - sample precision@N
   - online update evaluation
 - consider to store the hyperparameters in the model files as well
 - prediction certainty output
Data types
 - data types: introduce more properties
 - data type: symmetric matrix (vs. CorrelationMatrix)
 - profile+optimize data types
 - implement sparse matrices based on binary search
Architecture
 - tests/integration
   - test suite should also run for purely binary installation
 - web APIs
   - integrate with easyrec JavaScript API http://easyrec.org/ 
   - implement features similar to the Strands web service API or Hunch
 - internal APIs
   - interface(s) for recommenders that support online updates
   - define an easy interface for rating data access
     - allow lazy iteration
     - allow random and randomized access
     - allow creating splits for cross-validation w/o duplicating data
     - (maybe) get num_users, num_items, max_user_id, max_item_id
   - user and item IDs should be unsigned integers, not signed integers
   - generic optimization interface and algorithms (like Mallet)
   - consider using simulated multiple inheritance for the attribute-based recommenders:
     http://www.codeproject.com/KB/architecture/smip.aspx
 - data structures
   - rewrite rating data structures
     - implement easy interface (see above)
     - store in one list (as values, not references!)
     - create special index data structures on demand
   - redesign/rewrite implicit feedback data structures
   - parameterize types:
     - user and item IDs
     - stored ratings
     - prediction values (in C++ port)
 - engines
   - nicer, more generic structure for kNN engines
     - non-weighted kNN
     - more correlation/similarity measures
       - rename to Similarity (instead of Correlation)?
     - combine arbitrary similarity matrices
     - user-defined similarities
   - slope-one
       - different weighting schemes
 - distributed/parallel computing
   - use Parallel.ForEach for item recommender evaluation
     - as soon as Mono 2.8 is more widely available
   - multi-core support
   - GPU support
   - support for distributed computing
     - check out http://code.google.com/p/qizmt/ and http://mapsharp.codeplex.com/
 - source code organization
   - use one repository per component, instead of having everything in one repository
 - IO+storage
   - allow storage of models in database in addition to text files
   - store models via reflection (can save a lot of code)
   - faster reading of text files (less checks, at user request)
   - consider using the CsvReader class in the programs, so that we can get rid
     of our home-grown CSV reader stuff (possibly not worth the trouble)
     - http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/CsvReader.aspx
Misc features
 - use --param for command-line parameters
 - rewrite MF techniques using vector/matrix abstractions
 - output a nice table format for evaluation w/ R etc.
