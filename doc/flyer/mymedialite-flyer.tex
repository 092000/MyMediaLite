MyMediaLite is a lightweight, multi-purpose library
of recommender system algorithms.
It addresses the two most common scenarios in collaborative filtering,
rating prediction (e.g. on a scale of 1 to 5 stars)
and item prediction from implicit feedback (e.g. from clicks or purchase actions).

\section{Features}

\begin{itemize}
	\item dozens of different recommender engines
	\item collaborative and attribute-based methods
	\item evaluation routines for rating and item prediction:
	      MAE, RMSE, AUC, prec@N, NDCG
	\item simple text-based input format
	\item Written in C\#, works on Linux, Windows, Mac OS X (using Mono)
	\item Free/Open Source Software, distributed under the terms of the
	      GNU General Public License (GPL)
\end{itemize}

\section{For Researchers}
\begin{itemize}
	\item don't waste time implementing methods if you really want to study
	      other aspects of recommender systems
	\item use the standard algorithms as baseline methods in benchmarks
	\item use MyMediaLite's infrastructure to implement your own methods
\end{itemize}

\section{For Developers}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Add recommender system technologies to your software.
\end{itemize}

\section{For Students}
\begin{itemize}
	\item See how typical recommender system methods are implement.
	\item Use MyMediaLite as a basis for you school projects.
\end{itemize}

\section{Implemented Methods}
Rating Prediction
\begin{itemize}
	\item averages: global, user, item
	\item linear baseline method by Koren and Bell
	\item k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN):
		\begin{itemize}
			\item based on user or item similarities
			\item using collaborative or attribute (content) data
			\item different similarity measures
		\end{itemize}
	\item (Biased) matrix factorization
\end{itemize}

Item Prediction
\begin{itemize}
	\item Random
	\item Most Popular Item
	\item Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
	\item k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN):
		\begin{itemize}
			\item based on user or item similarities
			\item using collaborative or attribute (content) data
		\end{itemize}
	\item Weighted Regularized Matrix Factorization (WR-MF)
	\item Matrix Factorization Optimized for Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR-MF)
\end{itemize}
