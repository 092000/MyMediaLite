Requirements for running MyMediaLite:
 - Mono 2.8.x or another recent .NET runtime (Mono 2.10.x recommended)
 - Perl and File::Slurp for the download and data processing scripts
   (not necessary for running/building MyMediaLite)

Instructions:
 - For building from source, we recommend to use MonoDevelop 2.4 or later (2.6 recommended).
 - If you have the binary package, just copy its contents to wherever you
   want and run the programs from there.


Requirements for building MyMediaLite:
 - the above requirements plus
   - Doxygen 1.6.3 or later
   - NUnit (for building the unit tests)


Tested configurations:
 - Ubuntu 10.04
   - with manually installed Mono 2.10.5 and MonoDevelop 2.6
   - Doxygen 1.6.3
 - Debian Wheezy
   - with Mono 2.10.1 and MonoDevelop 2.4

Let us know on which configuration of .NET or Mono you are using MyMediaLite,
or whether you experience difficulties.
