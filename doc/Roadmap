TODO list (no particular order):
 - add function that maps original entity IDs to internal ones
 - add filtering mechanism (pre-filter, post-filter)
 - support for non-binary attributes
 - additional engines
   - non-negative matrix factorization (easy)
   - adaptive kNN by Koren+Bell
   - Hashing for CF: http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/papers/v9/karatzoglou10a/karatzoglou10a.pdf
 - parameterize types: user and item IDs, prediction values
 - nicer, more generic structure for kNN engines
   - non-weighted kNN
   - more correlation measures (Jaccard index)
 - faster evaluation routines
 - time-aware rating and item prediction
 - new engine types: TagRecommender, ContextAwareRecommender
 - ranking ensembles
 - generic optimization interface and algorithms (compare Mallet)
 - re-implement rating data structure
 - data types: introduce more properties
 - data type: symmetric matrix
 - profile+optimize data types
 - add a simple logging mechanism (interface with 4 delegates):
    - debug, info, warn; progress 
 - Java port 
 - multi-core support
 - GPU support
 - support for distributed computing
 - webservice interface
