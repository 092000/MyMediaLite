	new features:
         - Map user/item IDs to internal IDs on the fly. That makes it
           unnecessary to convert datasets before using them with the
           MyMediaLite command-line tools.
         - MAP (mean average precision) for item recommender evaluation
         - API documentation in XML (generated from the inline XML docs)
         - support recommenders that use relations over users and/or items
           using the interfaces UserRelationAwareRecommender and
           ItemRelationAwareRecommender
         - SocialMF by Jamali+Ester 2010
        engine changes:
         - added global bias term to BiasedMatrixFactorization
        changes to the command-line programs:
         - allow input from STDIN and output to STDOUT
	 - nicer time output for both demo programs
         - nicer result output for both demo programs
	 - rating prediction: save model earlier
         - rating prediction: option to stop iterating if there is no progress
         - always output '.'-separated floating point numbers, independent
           of the current locale.
         - better documentation of arguments
         - rating prediction: MAE and RMSE cutoff values for iteration search
         - give out data loading time
	interface changes:
	 - use IterativeModel interface in rating prediction program
	 - consistent parameters for RatingData constructor
	 - SparseBooleanMatrix now allows [x, y] and [x] access, has 
           properties instead of GetXXX() methods
         - Matrix now allows [x, y] access
         - UserAttributeAwareRecommender and ItemAttributeAwareRecommender
           now both are completely property-based
