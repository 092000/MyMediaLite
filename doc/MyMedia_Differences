Differences between MyMediaLite and the MyMedia Recommender Framework
1. MyMediaLite is Free and Open Source Software, published under the terms of
   GPLv3.
2. MyMediaLite is, as the name says, leaner and simpler and carries less
   overhead, in particular:
   - it does not presuppose special database schemas
   - it does not have a database connector
   - it contains a different set of recommender algorithms (even though
     there is an overlap)
   - it does not contain complex engines, recommender flows, (not yet)
     filters, etc.
